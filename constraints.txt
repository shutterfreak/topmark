# constraints.txt — upper bounds / pins for transient tooling conflicts
#
# Purpose:
#   This file constrains indirect dependencies that occasionally break our docs
#   or formatting toolchain. It is applied during *lock generation* (pip-compile)
#   so the resulting requirements*.txt remain compatible and reproducible.
#
# How it’s used:
#   The Makefile passes `-c constraints.txt` to pip-compile in the `compile`,
#   `compile-dev`, and `upgrade-dev` targets. No need to pass constraints to
#   pip-sync; the compiled locks already encode these limits.
#
# Review cadence:
#   Revisit monthly or when upstreams release fixes. To test lifting a pin:
#     pip-compile -U -c constraints.txt requirements-dev.in --dry-run
#   (remove or relax the relevant line locally, re-run compile, and verify)
#
# --- Tooling-specific constraints ---
# There are currently no known constraints.
