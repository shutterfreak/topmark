# TopMark configuration #
#########################
# This file is used to define the default configuration for TopMark.

# ------------------------------
# Config discovery & precedence
# ------------------------------
# TopMark discovers configuration from (lowest → highest precedence):
#   1. Built-in defaults (this file bundled with TopMark)
#   2. User config (~/.config/topmark/topmark.toml or ~/.topmark.toml)
#   3. Project configs discovered upward from the *discovery anchor* to the root
#      * The discovery anchor is the first input path (its parent if it's a file);
#        if no inputs are provided, the anchor is the current working directory.
#      * In each directory, TopMark considers both:
#          - pyproject.toml  (table: [tool.topmark])
#          - topmark.toml    (tool-specific file)
#        Same-directory precedence: pyproject.toml is merged first,
#        then topmark.toml overrides it.
#      * Directories are merged root → current (nearest wins).
#      * Set `root = true` in a discovered config to stop further upward traversal.
#   4. Extra config files passed explicitly via --config (merged in the order provided)
#   5. CLI overrides (highest precedence)
#
# Path resolution rules:
#   * Globs declared in config files are resolved relative to the directory that contains
#     that config file. Globs declared via CLI are resolved relative to the current working
#     directory (invocation site).
#   * Path-to-file settings (e.g., include_from/exclude_from/files_from) are resolved relative
#     to the declaring source (config file directory, or CWD for CLI options). The referenced
#     files’ own patterns are evaluated relative to each file’s own directory.
#   * `relative_to` affects only header metadata (e.g., `file_relpath`), not discovery.
#
# To mark a directory boundary for discovery, set:
#   root = true
# in `topmark.toml`, or within `[tool.topmark]` in `pyproject.toml`.
# The default is `root = false` (continue traversing parents).
#
# Special flags:
#   * --no-config disables user+project discovery (only defaults → --config → CLI).
#
# Example (uncomment to stop discovery above this directory):
# root = true


# ==========================
# Header field configuration
# ==========================

[header]
# Configuration for header fields and metadata to include in generated headers

# Ordered list of field names to render in the TopMark header.
#
# A field name may refer to:
#   1) a **built-in** field (computed from the filesystem), or
#   2) a **custom** field defined under the `[fields]` table below.
#
# Built-in field names (computed in `topmark.pipeline.steps.builder.BuilderStep`):
#   - file         : base file name (no path)
#   - file_relpath : file path relative to `files.relative_to` (or CWD if `files.relative_to` is unset)
#   - file_abspath : absolute file path
#   - relpath      : parent directory of `file_relpath`
#   - abspath      : parent directory of `file_abspath`
#
# Notes:
#   - The `[fields]` table may contain additional key/value pairs that are *not* listed here.
#     Only the names in `header.fields` are rendered in the header.
#   - If a custom field name overlaps with a built-in field name, TopMark will warn and the
#     custom value will override the built-in value *for rendering*.
fields = ["file", "file_relpath"]


# ========================
# TopMark field definition
# ========================

[fields]
# Definition of field names (keys) and values
#
# Note: keys defined here do not have to be rendered. Only keys listed in `header.fields`
# are included in generated headers.

# Project name to include in the header
# project = "TopMark"

# License to include in the header. Example values: 'MIT', 'GPL-3.0', 'Apache-2.0'
# license = "MIT"

# Copyright statement to include in the header.
# copyright = "(c) 2025 Your Name" # Update according to your needs


# ========================
# Formatting configuration
# ========================

[formatting]
# Formatting options for header rendering.

# Align the fields (colons) in the header for better readability. Values: true or false.
align_fields = true

# File header format (default, native, plain, json)
# header_format = "native"


# ====================
# Writer configuration
# ====================

[writer]
# Writer options.

# Where to emit results:
#   "file"   → write updates to the original files (default)
#   "stdout" → write updated content to stdout (no file writes)
#
# CLI equivalent:
#   --write-mode file
#   --write-mode stdout
target = "file"

# Strategy used when writing to files (ignored when target="stdout"):
#   "atomic"  → write to a temporary file and replace the original (safe, default)
#   "inplace" → overwrite the original file in place (faster, less safe)
#
# CLI equivalent:
#   --write-mode atomic
#   --write-mode inplace
strategy = "atomic"

# ======================
# Policy configuration
# ======================

[policy]
# Global policy that governs whether TopMark may add or update headers.
#
# add_only:
#   * true  → Only insert missing headers; do not update existing headers.
#   * false → Allow both insert and update (subject to other policy flags).
add_only = false
#
# update_only:
#   * true  → Only update existing headers; do not insert missing headers.
#   * false → Allow both update and insert (subject to other policy flags).
update_only = false
#
# allow_header_in_empty_files:
#   Permit inserting a header into an otherwise empty file (e.g., `__init__.py`).
#   This is disabled by default to avoid surprising diffs in empty placeholders.
allow_header_in_empty_files = false

# Per‑file‑type policy overrides.
# Define sub‑tables under `[policy_by_type.<file_type_id>]` to fine‑tune behavior.
#
# Example (uncomment to allow headers in empty Python files only):
#
# [policy_by_type.python]
# allow_header_in_empty_files = true


# ===================
# Files configuration
# ===================

[files]

# File discovery and filtering.
#
# Filtering order:
#   1. Path-based include/exclude (patterns, *_from, files_from)
#   2. File type include/exclude (include_file_types / exclude_file_types)
#   3. Per-file eligibility (supported vs unsupported)
#
# Include/exclude glob patterns.
# Patterns in config files are evaluated relative to the config file's directory.
# include_patterns = ["src/**", "tests/**"]
# exclude_patterns = [".venv/**", "**/__pycache__/**"]

# Load include/exclude patterns from files (one pattern per line; supports comments).
# These paths are resolved relative to the config file's directory.
# include_from = ["include.txt"]
# exclude_from = ["exclude.txt"]

# Provide the explicit file list from files (one path per line; supports comments).
# These paths are resolved relative to the config file's directory.
# files_from = ["files.txt"]

# Optional whitelist of file type identifiers to process (after include/exclude patterns):
# include_file_types = ["python", "markdown"]

# Optional blacklist of file type identifiers to exclude (after include/exclude patterns):
# exclude_file_types = ["html"]

# Optional list of input paths (files/directories) to scan.
# These are typically specified via CLI.
# files = ["src", "tests", "README.md"]

# Affects header metadata (e.g., file_relpath) only, not discovery.
# relative_to = "."
