# Internals (advanced) (%%TOPMARK_VERSION%%)

> [!WARNING]
> **Subject to change**
>
> The modules listed under *Internals* are intended for contributors and advanced users.
> They are **not** covered by the semver stability guarantees. Prefer the stable public API
> documented in **API → Public API**.

For details on how these pages are generated and validated, see
[Development → Documentation Pipeline & Reference Hygiene](../dev/documentation-pipeline.md).

This section provides per‑module reference pages generated during the docs build (see
`tools/docs/gen_api_pages.py`). They are not added individually to the navigation to keep the sidebar compact. Use the
search box to find symbols, or browse the generated paths under `/api/internals/topmark/...`.

These pages are generated automatically during the MkDocs build and should not be edited
manually. Any changes should be made in the corresponding Python source files under `src/`.

Browse the generated internals index: [`topmark` internals](internals/topmark/index.md)

You can also browse the full generated tree from the sidebar under **API → Internals → Reference (generated)**.
