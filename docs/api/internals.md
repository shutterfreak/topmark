# Internals (advanced)

!!! warning "Subject to change" The modules listed under *Internals* are intended for contributors
and advanced users. They are **not** covered by the semver stability guarantees. Prefer the stable
public API documented in **API → Public API**.

This section provides per‑module reference pages generated during the docs build (see
`docs/gen_api_pages.py`). They are not added to the navigation to keep the sidebar compact. Use the
search box to find symbols, or browse the generated paths under `/api/internals/topmark/...`.
